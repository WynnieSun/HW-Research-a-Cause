Develop Alternative Solutions,Finding as many solutions to the problem. Looking at how each solution relates to the root cause and symptoms of the problem. Deciding if different solutions can be merged to give a better answer to the problem.,"This step it is not about finding one solution, but eliminating the options that will prove less effective at dealing with the problem.",5%
Select a Solution,"Evaluate all the selected, potential solutions, and narrow it down to one.",Judge feasibility of each solution.,15%
Implement the Solution,Develop an action plan to implement and execute the solution process.,Need to determine which actions are necessary.,45%
Evaluate the Outcome,Designate feedback mechanisms to detect if the project is going off course. ,Evaluation helps the group decide if they need to return to a previous step or continue with the implementation. ,10%
